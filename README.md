# Employee Manager
## Introduction
An android application, built in Java. The application is connected to a Firebase Realtime Database instance and it allows user to perform CRUD operations through the app. It can read data from the database and show the stored employees in a custom list to the user. The application will also allow the user to add more employees, update existing employeeâ€™s demographics and remove an employee from the real-time database.

## Android Studio is required to run the application.

Note: I developed this project under a GitHub repository provided by my institution. It appears I don't have access to fork the course repository into my GitHub profile, so I copied the contents of the project and pasted into a newly created repository in my profile.
